Dropbeat
========

Dropbeat is online music player that lets you listen to music in online streaming sources better.

We all are tired of pressing refresh button to repeat youtube music and seeing commercial ads on youtube.

Furthermore, clicking favorite soundcloud tracks on my chrome bookmarks always makes me angry.

I'm a developer who loves music, especially EDM. 

`Dropbeat` is the manifestation of my interest to make a better interface to enjoying streaming music.
